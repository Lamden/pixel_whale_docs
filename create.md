# Creating a Masterpiece

This guide is going to be brief and short. Bottom line is we are going to create something in Pixel Whale and list it for sale!

Let’s get the housekeeping out of the way. Hopefully you will have followed some of the other sections and you are already setup and have funds, if not:  
* Getting Started — [guide here](setup.md#Getting-Setup)    
* Add Funds — [guide here](setup.md#Adding-Funds)    

1. OK, lets open Pixel Whale and click on CREATE. This is a very intuitive layout so I will run you through the basics based on the picture below:

    1A: Preview Window - for those creating animated GIFs this is very handy as it shows what your end creation will look like.   
    1B: Animation speed - as it says, a great feature to adjust the frames of your animations (have a play and find the right speed for your animation in the preview window).   
    1C: Control Panel, allowing you to start new art (autosaved old), a quick clear or deletion of the current frame or wiping your whole project to start again. It also contains to MINT NFT button (see instructions below when you are finished)   
    1D: A handy autosave - off chain so it is free! Create projects, stop, start others, load old projects! Brilliant!   
    1E: Animation frames - allows you to add extra frames (up to 8) - it copies the previous frame when you do it, so that is a cool feature to save time   
    1F: 25x25 drawing area - get crazy!   
    1G: Drawing color selection - left or right click the palette below it to select colors for each mouse button   
    1H: Drawing tools - all you need to easy pixel art, a fill tool and a brush tool including brush size below - give it a try!   

>[!Tip]
> That is basically it, get creative! Try different things because it is free, none of the changes you make or extra frames you add cost you anything, it is all 'off-chain' until you click MINT NFT.   

2. When you are happy with your creation and want to 'save' it permanently to the Lamden Blockchain, click **MINT NFT**.   

3. You will get a pop-up where you can name your creation and provide a description (128 characters max). As the artist you can also set royalties - this allows you to collect a % you set per subsequent sale of the art. Similar to my masterpiece below, put in your details, adjust your royalty slider, then click **Mint NFT**.   

>[!Warning]
> This is your one time to adjust royalties - it can't be done after you have created the NFT.

4. In the bottom right corner you will get a 'pending' notification, then it will tell you your creation is now on the Lamden Blockchain:

5. Thinking of selling your masterpiece? No problem! In the menu options click on Owned, this will load all the art you currently own. You will see you newly created piece waiting for you. Click on the small **SELL** button just below the art.

6. You will get pop-up similar to below, input your sale price (in TAU). Clicking list item will cost a small transaction fee (about 1 TAU) so make sure you want to proceed. Also make sure you understand, as soon as it is listed for sale, people can buy your art for the price you have specified - automatically. This happens all on-chain and the person who buys will be the new owner of your art. If you are happy with your price, click **List NFT**.
