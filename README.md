### What is Pixel Whale?
Pixel Whale brings together pixel art creators and buyers on a simple platform fully integrated with the [Lamden Blockchain](https://www.lamden.io). It allows everyone to browse art and artists to easily create NFTs with listing options for buyers to purchase on the marketplace.

### Who are the team behind Pixel Whale?
Jeff Scott from the Lamden Developer team is the creator.

### Do I need TAU to use the site?
Technically... no, but let me explain. You can browse the art and can also create art and it will save locally to your browser storage.  However if you want to do any on-chain actions (minting NFTS, buying, liking, selling etc) you will need some TAU.  So if you feel like having a draw first - give it a try.

### I found a bug!
Submit an [issue](https://github.com/Lamden/pixel_whale_docs/issues) on Github - That way you can check to see if anyone else has reported it and this is also the best way to ensure the developer sees it.

### Why no $WHALE token?
There was no need to create a whale token, Lamden TAU serves the same purpose — as a store of value and handles all NFT storage on-chain.

### What fees apply?
All transactions are performed through smart contracts on the Lamden Blockchain. Pixel Whale takes no fee for any transactions on the site.

### But… how does Pixel Whale pay to keep the lights on?
Pixel Whale was a passion project and one enjoyed by the community in it’s original iteration on Lamden test network (originally called Pixel Frames). Pixel Whale generates a small income stream through feedback mechanisms provided by Lamden to support early developers who use the Lamden network.

### There is a watermark on the art!
The watermark is placed on art that you don’t own and the removal is a special perk for owners of that particular piece of art. If there is a watermark on something you own, perhaps it was sold to someone else before you posted the image. Check to make sure you still own the art.

### My share link does not work!
Check to make sure you still own the art. The link is made invalid after every sale of the art.
